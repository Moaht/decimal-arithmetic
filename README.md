==========================

This is a decimal arithmetic package for Haskell, suitable for
arbitrary-precision decimal floating point and integer calculations.

For details and the specification on which the implementation is based, see
Mike Cowlishaw's [General Decimal Arithmetic][].

While currently usable, the implementation is still under development.
Additional operations and possible API changes are planned.
